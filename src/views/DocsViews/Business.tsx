                This team is responsible for the financial sustainability of the team. Members of this team connect to, and keep
                record of, potential sponsors within the community through emails and phone calls. Through this process, sponsor
                relations are developed and maintained to ensure a consistent flow of funds. While monetary donations allow for
                higher control over fund allocation, resources are equally appreciated. Many tasks involved are entry-level and
                build strong communication, negotiation, organization skills, and patience that are practical on the team and in
                real-world situations.

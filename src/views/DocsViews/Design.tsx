                This team focuses on the initial concept of the Robot. Through use of CAD, ideally, a working digital model
                of the Robot mechanisms will be the first priority (completed alongside build) to serve as a resource for
                build dimensions, the placement of electrical components, and as future reference for later seasons.
                Therefore, a coherent design must be decided within the 1-2 weeks of build season.<br/><br/>
                The documentation in this section is intended to help design team members in the design process to rapidly
                design a robot.

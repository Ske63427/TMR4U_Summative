                This team is responsible for designing and maintaining the software that runs on the robot. This can include the
                robot's control system, autonomous routines, computer vision, and more. The programming team is also generally
                responsible for updating and flashing any related firmware, such as on the RoboRIO, radio, and motor controllers.
                The programming team works closely with both the electrical and design teams to ensure the seamless integration
                of software with the robot's electrical components and mechanical structure.General programming knowledge, and
                skills in Java, systems design, control algorithms, version control, and troubleshooting are of great benefit.
